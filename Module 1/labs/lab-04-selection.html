        <h3>Student Information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Name: Tanner Heimsch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name in the appropriate location.</li>
          <li>After each line, "Scenario" add a block of text that restates the scenario in pseudocode in the "Pseudocode" block. Use the <span class="caps">IF...THEN...ELSE...ENDIF </span>structure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Here's an Example.  I wrote the pseudocode under the "Pseudocode" label:</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
Scenario:

I can hardly wait for Friday because if my pay check is big enough I'm going to
buy a new guitar at The Music Centre on Saturday. I'll be disappointed if I
can't get it.

Pseudocode:
BEGIN
  wait for Friday
  IF paycheck total is big enough THEN
    wait for Saturday
    go to The Music Centre
    buy guitar
  ELSE
    cry
    stamp foot
  ENDIF
END

</pre>

        <p><em>Okay...your turn...think it through, and have fun! </em> <br />
          Use Notepad++ to write your pseudocode under the "Pseudocode" label below. Be sure to use the IF ELSE ENDIF block like I did.  And, yes, indentation is important, too!</p>
        <h3>Your Output:</h3>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
Scenario:

We're going to Disney World this summer! We're going to fly there in August.
Well, we have to make sure we have enough money first. It will be a sad August
if we're still home.


Pseudocode:
BEGIN
  wait for August
  IF enoughMoney THEN
    book flight
    fly to Disneyland
    have fun
  ELSE
    be sad
  ENDIF
END

</pre>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
Scenario:

I'm going to walk to the ice cream store and get something good! I'm hoping that
chocolate fudge is the special because I'll get a double then. I can only afford
a single normally.

Pseudocode:
BEGIN
  walk to Ice Cream Store
  IF (chocolateFudge === "theSpecial") THEN
    get double scoop
  ELSE
    get single scoop
  ENDIF
END

</pre>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
Scenario:

When I retire I'm going to make furniture. It only depends on my health and the
stock market!


Pseudocode:
BEGIN
  retirement
  IF (health === "good") THEN
    make furniture
  ELSEIF (stockMarket === "good") THEN 
    make more furniture
  ELSE
    keep working
  ENDIF
END

</pre>

<p>And once more, with feeling!</p>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
Scenario:

When the user enters a password, check to see if the password is "password". 
If it is, tell them they have a terrible password. Otherwise welcome them.

Pseudocode:
BEGIN
  enter password
  IF (password === "password") THEN
    alert("You have a terrible password!")
  ELSE
    alert("Welcome, password Guru.")
  ENDIF
END

</pre>

        <h3>What You Did</h3>
        <p>You practiced writing pseudocode to demonstrate SELECTION from a simple scenario written in plain English. Go Back to the previous page.</p>
