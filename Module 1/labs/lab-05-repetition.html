        <h3>Student Information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Name:  Tanner Heimsch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name as always.</li>
          <li>Use Notepad++ to write simple Pseudocode for each of the three scenarios below.</li>
          <li>After each Scenario, under the "Pseudocode" label, add a block of text that restates the scenario in pseudocode that shows REPETITION. Use the <span class="caps">WHILE...</span>condition...ENDWHILE structure, just like I did in the example.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>My Turn (here's where I wrote the pseudocode):</h3>

<pre class="pseudocode">
Scenario:

It seems like it won't stop snowing until June!


Pseudocode:
BEGIN
  WHILE not June
    snow daily
  ENDWHILE
END

</pre>
        <h3>Now it's your turn! Your Output (here's where YOU write the pseudocode):</h3>
        <p>For each one of these scenarios, write the pseudocode. Each of your examples should look just like mine. </p>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
Scenario:

I'm not going to get a good night's sleep while I have kids in the house.


Pseudocode:
BEGIN
  WHILE kidsInHouse
    badNightOfSleep
  ENDWHILE
END

</pre>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
Scenario:

I couldn't breathe when she was in the room. Her perfume was so strong!

Pseudocode:
BEGIN
  WHILE shesInRoom
    cantBreathe
  ENDWHILE
END

</pre>


<pre class="student pseudocode">
Scenario:

I have 10 apples and I'm going to give everyone one apple until I run out.

Pseudocode:
BEGIN
  WHILE apples is less than 10
    Display remaining apples
    subtract 1 from apples
  ENDWHILE
END

</pre>
