        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open this file in both Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name to the page.</li>
          <li>Test that you added your information correctly.</li>
          <li>Read through my problem statement.</li>
          <li>Review my example solution.</li>
          <li>Add your lab after the line: <code class="keyword">YOUR PSEUDOCODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:</code>.</li>
          <li>Add pseudocode for the following scenario.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>My Turn:</h3>
        <p>A customer deposits 2 checks and wants a receipt printed for the entire amount of the deposit. If the entire deposit is greater than $1000.00 then the customer earns a $5.00 bonus. The receipt should display the customer's name and total deposit.  If the customer has a bonus the receipt should include the $5.00 in the total deposit and alert the customer. </p>
        <p>Here's my pseudocode.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
Customer Deposit Receipt Pseudocode

BEGIN
  initialize check1 to 0
  initialize check2 to 0
  initialize customerName to ""
  initialize output to ""

  prompt for customerName
  prompt for check1 with "What is the first check?"
  prompt for check2 with "What is the second check?"

  totalDeposit = check1 + check2

  output = customerName + "\n"
  output = output +  totalDeposit + "\n"

  IF totalDeposit > 1000 THEN
    totalDeposit = totalDeposit + 5
    output = output +  "Congratulations - you earned a $5.00 bonus!"
  ENDIF

  display output
END

</pre>
        <div class="notice">
          <p>Pay attention to all the things I did in my example. Look at the indentation. Look
            at how specific I was. As you write pseudocode, strive for that
            level of clarity.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h3>Your Turn: </h3>
        <p>Your Scenario: </p>
        <blockquote>An instructor needs to key in three grades.  The grades need to be averaged.  Then the letter grade should be determined. An average score between 70 and 100 earns a grade of "P", whereas any average score  <strong>below 70</strong> earns an "F". The average and the letter grade should display on a screen. </blockquote>

YOUR PSEUDOCODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:

  // Define variables

  // Prompt user for grades
  prompt for grade1 with "Enter grade 1:"
  prompt for grade2 with "Enter grade 2:"
  prompt for grade3 with "Enter grade 3:"

  // Calculate the average of the three grades
  average = (grade1 + grade2 + grade3) / 3

  // Define output concatenation
  output = average + "\n"
