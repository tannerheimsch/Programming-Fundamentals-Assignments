        <h2>Lab 7: Pseudocode</h2>
        <h4>File: /Labs/lab-07-pseudocode.html</h4>
        <h3>Student Information</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Name: Tanner Heimsch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open this file in both Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name to the page.</li>
          <li>Test that you added your information correctly.</li>
          <li>Write pseudocode for the following procedure:
            <ol>
              <li>For every employee in the company
                <ul>
                  <li>Ask for his or her last name and store it in a variable.</li>
                  <li>Ask for his or her weekly salary and store it in a variable.
                    <ul>
                      <li>If the salary is <strong>not greater than 1000</strong>, display a message that says &ldquo;Evaluate employee <strong>name</strong> for a raise.&rdquo; (where <strong>name</strong> is the name of the employee you stored.)
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Also, increment a variable that keeps track of the number of employees that need evaluation.</li>
                  </ul>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                At  the end of the program, after all of the employees have been scanned,
                display a final message that shows the total number of employees that need to have their salaries
                evaluated. For  example, if there were 100 employees, but only 20 employees that needed evaluation, the program should say: <br><br>
                &ldquo;The  total number of employees that need to be evaluated is 20.&rdquo; 
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>HINT:</strong> You will need a WHILE statement and inside the WHILE you will have one IF statement.</p>
            <p>Think about the keywords you'd use for each step and include those, but remember
              that <span data-scayt_word="pseudocode" data-scaytid="12">pseudocode</span> isn't a real programming language -
              it's just a loose way of expressing how your program might work. <br>
            </p>
            <p>Pay special attention to the algorithm. What <span data-scayt_word="pseudocode" data-scaytid="15">pseudocode</span> keywords do you use to <strong>compare and make a choice?</strong> What about <strong>asking for input</strong> and <strong>storing</strong> values?</p>
</li>
          <li>Add your pseudocode so it appears in the black box, after the line: <code class="keyword">YOUR PSEUDOCODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:</code></li>
          <li>Save your lab and take some extra time to try to run through the logic in your head.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Your Pseudocode:</h3>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
YOUR PSEUDOCODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:
BEGIN
  // Define variables
  initialize numEmployees to 0
  initialize numEvaluted to 0
  initialize salary to 0
  initialize lastName to ""

  // Prompt user for information, evaluate whether or not they need a raise
  WHILE thereAreMoreEmployees DO
  prompt for lastName with "Enter your last name:"
  prompt for salary with "Enter your weekly salary:"
    IF salary <= 1000 THEN
      display "Evaluate employee " + lastName + " for a raise."
      numEvaluated = numEvaluated + 1
    ENDIF
    set numEmployees = numEmployees + 1
  ENDWHILE
  
  // Display total # of employees that need a salary evaluation
  display "The total number of employees that need to be evaluated is " + numEvaluated + "out of " + numEmployees + "total employees."
END
END YOUR PSEUDOCODE BEFORE THIS LINE

        <h3>What You Did</h3>
        <p>You took a program specification and wrote the pseudocode for it, practicing programming logic.</p>
