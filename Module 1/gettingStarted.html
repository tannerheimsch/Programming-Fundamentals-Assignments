        <p>If you have questions - be sure to ask!!!</p>
        <p><strong>Be sure you have already reviewed the presentations in this week's Module in Canvas and be sure you are comfortable with:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Introduction to HTML</li>
          <li>Using Notepad++ and Firefox to edit and view HTML Files</li>
          <li>The settings for Notepad++</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You will be writing a lot this semester. But, it won't be essays, book reviews, or research papers! What you will be writing is code, like this: </p>
          
              
<pre><code class="js">
// JavaScript Code
var name = &quot;Bill&quot;;

if(name === &quot;Bill&quot;) {
  document.write(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name);
}
</code></pre>
           
        
        <h3>Editing The Learning Units</h3>
        <p>You'll need to make modifications to the HTML files in the learning unit. Each time you have a unit, you'll need to open up the HTML file in Notepad++ and make changes.</p>
        <p>Let's start with something simple. Let's add your name to the Home Page (index.html) of this learning unit.</p>
        <p class="lab_link"><a href="labs/lab-00-practice.html">Lab 0: Practice Lab</a></p>
        <h3>Ensure Your Editor Is Configured!</h3>
        <p>Here's a review of Notepad++ settings: <a href="notepadSettings.html">Required Notepad++ Settings</a>.</p>
        <h3>Your First Real Lab</h3>
        <p>Okay, now you are ready for the first "real" lab...and some JavaScript.</p>
        <p class="lab_link"> <a href="labs/lab-01-editing.html">Lab 1: Editing</a></p>
        <h3>Review Lab </h3>
        <p>Now let's do one more lab for this section of the learning unit. Practice makes perfect, right?</p>
        <p class="lab_link"> <a href="labs/lab-02-editingReview.html">Lab 2: Editing Review Lab</a><br />
        </p>
