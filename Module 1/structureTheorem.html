        <h1>The Structure Theorem</h1>
        <p><em>The Structure Theorem helps us break down a problem or a system into small parts that can be easily coded. It is also known as The Structured Program Theorem</em>. </p>
        <p>The theorem states that it is possible to write any computer program by using only three basic control structures that are easily represented in pseudocode. Here they are:</p>
        <ul style="padding-left:55px;">
          <li><strong>Sequence</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Selection</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Repetition</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Sequence</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em>This is putting one foot before the other. You have to tell a computer to do one thing at a time, in a sequence of statements.</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>In pseudocode we will see things like this:</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
prompt user for name
display name</pre>

<pre class="pseudocode">
set firstName to Fred
set lastName to Flintstone
fullName = firstName and lastName with a space in between
add fullName to names list </pre>

        <ul>
          <li>If the order isn't correct in each of those blocks of pseudocode, then things won't work when we convert the pseudocode into programming code.</li>
          <li>For example, the SEQUENCE of the following statements is very important! You wouldn't get the correct answer for "area" if you didn't have the correct values in "length" and "width" first!</li>
        </ul>

<pre><code class="js">
// Statement

length = 4;
width = 5;
area = length * width;
</code></pre>

        <p>Time for a bit of practice: </p>
        <p class="lab_link"><a href="labs/lab-03-sequence.html">Lab 3: Sequence</a></p>
        <h3>Selection</h3>
        <p><em>Selection means that our program needs to make a decision to go one way or another. It does this by first testing something. Is the door locked? Is this number smaller than 500? Is the user logged in? Once it has done the test it will then run one of two statements or sequence of statements.</em></p>
        <p>In pseudocode we use a simple <span class="caps">IF, THEN, ELSE </span>block to represent this</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
IF condition p is true THEN
  statement(s) in true case
ELSE
  statement(s) in false case
ENDIF</pre>

        <p>Here's a pseudocode example that uses the <span class="caps">IF, THEN, ELSE </span>block to show SELECTION:</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
Check to see what the price is
IF the price is less than $10
  pay with my $10 bill
ELSE
  pay with my charge card
ENDIF
Collect the receipt and go home</pre>

        <p>In JavaScript code we also use an <strong>if</strong> construct that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="js">
// Selection in JavaScript

if (something === 1) {
  // some good code here
} else {
  // some really good code here!
}
</code></pre>

        <p>More about JavaScript code later.  For now, let's use pseudocode to practice: </p>
        <p class="lab_link"><a href="labs/lab-04-selection.html">Lab 4: Selection</a></p>
        <h3>Repetition</h3>
        <p><em>REPETITION refers to a set of statements or instructions that will be performed over and over. Walking, doing the dishes, and playing tennis are examples of activities where certain steps are repeated over and over. In programming repetition is also called <strong>iteration</strong> or <strong>looping</strong>.</em></p>
        <p>In pseudocode we write it as:</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
WHILE condition is true
  statement block
  another statement block
ENDWHILE</pre>

        <p>Or</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
DOWHILE condition is true
  statement block
  another statement block
ENDDO</pre>

        <p>We sometimes need to do a process until it's done. Like washing dishes:</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
WHILE there are dirty dishes in the stack
  dip dish in soapy water in sink
  rub dish with sponge
  rinse dish in clean water
  place dish in draining rack to dry
ENDWHILE</pre>

        <p>Or perhaps we need to hand out pens to everyone until we run out of pens. One way we can express this
          is like this:</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
WHILE I have pens in my hand
  give one to a student
END
Tell everyone I'm out of pens.
</pre>

        <p>Each time I give a pen away, I have one less pen in my hand. When I no longer have any pens, I'm done. Note that the steps inside the repeating process are indented. But the last step,
          where I tell people I'm out of pens, is outside. It happens <b>after</b> I have given all my pens away.</p>


        <p>We can use repeating processes to count up to a value. </p>
<pre class="pseudocode">
  Initialize count to 0
  WHILE the count is less than 10
    Display count
    add 1 to count
  ENDWHILE
</pre>

        <p>And we can even do selection inside of repeating processes.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
  Initialize count to 0
  WHILE the count is less than 10
    IF count is an even number THEN
      Display count
    END
    add 1 to count
  ENDWHILE
</pre>

        <p>In JavaScript we will be using a few different repetition structures. Here are two examples.</p>
<pre><code class="js">
// Repetition with a while loop

var count = 0;
while(count &lt; 10) {
  document.write(count);  // prints out the count
  count = count + 1;      // adds one to the count
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="js">
// Repetition with a for loop

for(var count = 0 ; count &lt; 10; count++) {
  document.write(count);
}
</code></pre>

        <p>Don't worry, we won't be writing these kinds of things in JavaScript just yet. This is just a chance for you to see what's coming.</p>
        <p>Lab time again!</p>
