        <h2>A while loop with unknown loop count</h2>
        <h3>Unknown Loops with <code>while</code></h3>

        <p><em>We don't know when it will stop, it just depends.</em></p>
        <p>When we code a loop that does not have a pre-set number of times to repeat, we need a way to stop the loop when it is done. There are two common approaches:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Loop until some predetermined value is read, like "quit".</li>
          <li>Loop and read data until we reach the end of the data.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Stop On A Sentinel</h3>
        
        <p>sen&#8226;ti&#8226;nel  </p>

        <p>Definition: (noun)...a soldier or guard whose job is to stand and keep watch.</p>
        
        <p>The term <strong>sentinel</strong> in programming means a special value that a program is looking for to take certain actions. Here are some examples.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A program that asks a user to enter words until the entered word is, "quit".</li>
          <li>A program that reads records from a file until it reaches a customer number that is 999999.</li>
          <li>A program that performs security scans on a hard drive every half hour until midnight, it then outputs a report for the previous day and starts over.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The End is Near</h3>
        
        <p><em>Read until we're done.</em></p>
        
        <p>Our programs read data from sources like files and database tables.</p>
        <p>We often need to read until we've read everything.</p>
        <p>Sentinels are not used as much as they used to be. Modern languages are better equipped to loop until we're done.</p>
        <h3>Lab Time</h3>
