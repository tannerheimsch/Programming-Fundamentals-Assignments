        <h4>File: /labs/lab04firstWhileLoop.html</h4>

        <h3>Student Information</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Name: Tanner Heimsch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name to the appropriate spot in the file.</li>
          <li>Read the problem statement.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Nouns and Verbs" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Defining Diagram" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Checking the Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Now open the <strong>JavaScript file</strong> unit6/labs/js/lab04firstWhileLoop.js in Notepad++.
            <ol>
              <li> (You might notice that the .js file already contains a <code>document.write</code> statement. It's only there to help you by displaying some output for you BEFORE you add any code. Since it displays the name of the .js file, it should help you tell if you are using the correct .js file, too!)</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Within that JavaScript file, create a JavaScript program that solves the given problem statement.
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Remember, you don't need to put &lt;script&gt; tags in this file - it must only contain valid JavaScript code.</strong></li>
              <li>Note that the code to call the function has already been added to this HTML file (labs/lab04firstWhileLoop.html) for you.
                <ol>
                  <li>Note that the changes to the <code>head</code> tag in this HTML file have been added, too, in order to point this page to the correct .js file.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li> Your output should look like the <strong>Example Output</strong> below.</li>
              <li>Remember to follow all coding standards and add appropriate comments!</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Test everything. How many test plans do you need to completely test this?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Lab Problem Statement</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong><em>Write a program that uses a WHILE loop. Inside the loop, the program asks a user to enter something, displaying their input back to them each time. When the loop has completed five times, thank the user for participating. </em></strong></p>
          <p>Use a while loop with a counter variable that you increment with the ++ operator. The while loop should check the counter to know when to stop. Ensure the loop only happens five times!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the above problem statement and paste it below so it appears in the black box when you refresh the page, underneath the words <code class="varname">PROBLEM STATEMENT</code>.</li>
          <li>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and write them in the appropriate locations so they appear in the black box below when you refresh the page.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="student pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write a program that uses a WHILE loop. Inside the loop, the program asks a 
  user to enter something, displaying their input back to them each time. When the loop has 
  completed five times, thank the user for participating.

Nouns: WHILE loop, their input, each time, five times

Verbs: asks, enter, displaying, thank

</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</li>
          <li>Make your variable names <strong>valid JavaScript names</strong> that conform to the course JavaScript Coding Standards.</li>
          <li>Write down the processes with very short statements, 2 or 3 words. Remember, this is not pseudocode. This is just the process.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  userInput

PROCESSING:
  prompt a user for userInput
  add one counter to loopCount for each userInput
  output each userInput until loopCount reaches 5
  output userGratitude once loop is done

OUTPUTS:
  userInput
  userGratitude
</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a solution algorithm (using Pseudocode) based on the defining diagram. Remember to give your algorithm a name and use proper indentation.</li>
          <li>Ensure you include an appropriate level of detail for your input, processing, and output logic.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="student pseudocode">SOLUTION ALGORITHM GOES HERE:

UserInputWhileLoop
  Initialize userInput to ""
  Initialize userGratitude to ""
  Initialize loopCount to 0

  WHILE loopCount < 5
    prompt user for userInput with "Please enter something you would like to see displayed:"
    display "You entered: " + userInput + "\n"
    add 1 to loopCount
  ENDWHILE

  userGratitude = "Thanks for participating!"
  display userGratitude
END
</pre>

        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a test plan for the algorithm.
            <ul>
              <li>Don't forget to fill in the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> section! That's easy to miss!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Have <b>at least 3 test cases</b> that test different inputs and outputs. </li>
        </ul>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
