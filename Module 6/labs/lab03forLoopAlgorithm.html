        <h3>Student Information</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Name: Tanner Heimsch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name in the appropriate spot.</li>
          <li>Locate the <code class="keyword">calculateAverage</code> algorithm in Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Complete the Solution Algorithm based on the following problem statement, nouns and verbs, and defining diagram. All you need to do is replace the question marks with the appropriate code!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

        <blockquote><p><strong><em><br />
            A program is required that asks a user to enter a number for a "counter". The program then asks the user to enter numbers, one at a time, in a loop for the number of times specified in the "counter". The program will output the "counter" number, each entered number, and after all the numbers are entered, then output the average of the entered numbers.<br />
        </em></strong></p></blockquote>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>I've already identified the nouns and verbs in the problem statement for you, but please study it carefully.</p></blockquote>


<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  A program is required that asks a user to
  enter a number for a "counter". The program then asks the
  user to enter numbers, one at a time, in a loop for the number of
  times specified in the counter.
  The program will output the counter number, each entered number, and
  after all numbers are entered, then output the average of the
  entered numbers.

Nouns: loop counter number, entry number, average

Verbs: ask, output, calculate average
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <p>I've already converted the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and created a defining diagram for you. Study this diagram though and be sure you nderstand how it works.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  loopCounter
  number

PROCESSING:
  prompt a user for a loopCounter
  convert loopCounter to a number
  prompt a user for a numberIn for the loopCounter number of times
  convert each numberIn
  add each number to numberTotal
  output the loopCounter, and each numberIn
  calculate numberAverage after loop is done
  output numberAverage

OUTPUTS:
  loopCounter
  numberIn
  numberAverage

</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <p>This is the solution algorithm. <strong>Replace</strong> <strong>the </strong><span class="pseudocode">???????</span> in the pseudocode below to complete the algorithm. </p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
calculateAverage
  prompt user for loopCounter
  convert loopCounter to a number
  LOOP starting at 0 to loopCounter in increments of 1
    prompt user for numberIn
    convert numberIn to a number
    add numberIn to numberTotal
    output loopCounter and numberIn
  END LOOP
  numberAverage = numberTotal / loopCounter
  output numberTotal and numberAverage
END
</pre>
        <h2>What You Did</h2>
        <p>You learned how you could use loops and a counter to repeat a process a fixed number of times, and you expressed this in pseudocode.</p>
