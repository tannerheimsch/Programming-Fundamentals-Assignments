        <h3>Student Information</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Name: Tanner Heimsch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name in the appropriate place.</li>
          <li>Locate the <code class="keyword">calculateAverageStringLength</code> algorithm in Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Complete the Solution Algorithm based on the following problem statement, nouns and verbs, and defining diagram. All you need to do is replace the question marks with the appropriate code!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

        <blockquote><p><strong><em>Define an algorithm that asks a user to enter 5 strings using a loop. Output each string and its length as it is entered, and output the calculated average length of the strings after the entry has finished.</em></strong></p></blockquote>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>

        <blockquote><p>I've already identified the nouns and verbs in the problem statement for you, but please study it carefully.</p>
        </blockquote>

<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  Define an algorithm that ask a user to enter 5 strings
  using a loop. Display each string as they are entered
  and display the calculated average length of the strings after
  the entry has finished.

Nouns: 5 strings, 5 lengths, average length

Verbs: ask, calculate, display
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>

        <blockquote><p>I've already converted the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and created a defining diagram for you. Study this diagram though and be sure you understand how it works.</p>
        </blockquote>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  stringIn (five times)

PROCESSING:
  prompt user 5 times for a string
  display each string
  determine and display length of each string
  calculate the average length of the 5 strings
  display average length

OUTPUTS:
  stringIn (five times)
  length of stringIn (five times)
  average length

</pre>


        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>

        <blockquote>
          <p>This is the solution algorithm. <strong>Replace</strong> <strong>the </strong><span class="pseudocode">???????</span> in the pseudocode below to complete the algorithm</p></blockquote>


<pre class="pseudocode">
calculateAverageStringLength
  set counter to zero
  WHILE counter &lt; 5
    prompt user for stringIn
    determine length of stringIn
    output stringIn and its length
    add stringIn length to totalLengths
    add 1 to counter
  ENDWHILE
  calculate avgLengthString = totalLengths/5
  output "The average length of the entered strings is " + avgLengthString + "."
END
</pre>

        <h2>What You Learned</h2>
        <p>You learned how you might use loops to repeat a process a fixed number of times, and you expressed this in pseudocode.</p>
