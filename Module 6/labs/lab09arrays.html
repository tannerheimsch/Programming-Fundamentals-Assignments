        <h4>File: unit6/labs/lab09arrays.html</h4>

        <h3>Student Information</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Name: Tanner Heimsch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name in the appropriate place.</li>
          <li>Read the problem statement.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Nouns and Verbs" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Defining Diagram" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Checking the Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Now open the file <strong>unit6/labs/js/lab09arrays.js </strong>in Notepad++</li>
          <li>In that JavaScript file, write a JavaScript program in the function <strong>lab09arrays</strong> that addresses the problem statement.
            <ol>
              <li>Your output should look like the <strong>Example Output</strong> at the bottom of the lab.</li>
              <li>Remember to follow all coding standards and add appropriate comments!</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Test everything. How many test plans do you need to completely test this?</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Lab Problem Statement</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong><em>Write a program that asks for student usernames. Collect student usernames until the user enters &quot;done&quot;. Once all the data has been gathered, the program should display the total number of records you collected. It should then convert the usernames to student email addresses (by appending @student.cvtc.edu&quot;) and display the converted addresses in a list as shown in the example output.</em></strong></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You'll use both FOR and WHILE loops in this problem, as well as an IF statement. You'll use an <strong>array</strong> to store the usernames.</p>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the above problem statement and paste it below so it appears in the black box when you refresh the page, underneath the words <code class="varname">PROBLEM STATEMENT</code>.</li>
          <li>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and write them in the appropriate locations so they appear in the black box below when you refresh the page.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
PROBLEM STATEMENT: Write a program that asks for student usernames. Collect student usernames 
  until the user enters "done". Once all the data has been gathered, the program should display 
  the total number of records you collected. It should then convert the usernames to student 
  email addresses (by appending @student.cvtc.edu") and display the converted addresses in a 
  list as shown in the example output.

Nouns: student usernames, "done", number of records, student email addresses, list

Verbs: asks, collect, enters, gathered, display, collected, convert
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</li>
          <li>Make your variable names <strong>valid JavaScript names</strong> that conform to the course JavaScript Coding Standards.</li>
          <li>Write down the processes with very short statements, 2 or 3 words. Remember, this is not pseudocode. This is just the process.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  studentUsername
  studentList

PROCESSING:
  prompt student for studentUsername
  alert user if they don't enter one username
  loop studentUsername until they enter done
  alert user if they enter a space in the username
  add studentUsername to end of studentList array
  convert studentUsername to email by appending @student.cvtc.edu
  add the email to the end of the studentEmailList array
  display the total number of records collected
  display the list of student email addresses

OUTPUTS:
  totalRecords
  studentEmailList
</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a solution algorithm (using Pseudocode) based on the defining diagram. Remember to give your algorithm a name and use proper indentation.</li>
          <li>Ensure you include an appropriate level of detail for your input, processing, and output logic.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">SOLUTION ALGORITHM GOES HERE:

StudentEmailGenerator
  Initialize array studentUsernameList to ""
  Initialize array studentEmailList to ""
  Initialize generatorDone to "false"
  Initialize totalRecords to 0

  WHILE generatorDone is false
    prompt for studentUsername with "Enter a student username (i.e. jsmith), type 'done' once you are finished."
    IF studentUsername is "done"
      IF studentUsernameList = 0 THEN
        alert "Please enter at least one username."
      ELSE
      generatorDone = "true"
      ENDIF
    ELSE IF studentUsername includes a space THEN
      alert "Username cannot contain spaces. Please try again."
    ELSE studentUsername is not an empty string THEN
      push studentUsername to studentUsernameList
    ENDIF
  ENDWHILE

  FOR each studentUsername in studentEmailList
    SET studentEmail = studentUsernameList + "@student.cvtc.edu"
    push studentEmail to studentEmailList
  END FOR

  Set totalRecords = length of studentUsernameList

  IF totalRecords = 1 THEN
    display "You entered 1 username. Here is the email address:\n\n"
  ELSE
    display "You entered " + totalRecords + " usernames. Here are the email addresses:\n\n"
  ENDIF
  display studentEmailList + "\n"
END
</pre>

        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a test plan for the algorithm.
            <ul>
              <li>Don't forget to fill in the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> section! That's easy to miss!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Have <b>at least 3 test cases</b> that test different inputs and outputs. </li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
VARIABLES: studentUsername

    You entered 1 username. Here is the email address:

    theimsch@student.cvtc.edu

  ACTUAL RESULT:
      >Please enter at least one username
    You entered 1 username. Here is the email address:

    theimsch@student.cvtc.edu
</pre>
        <h3>5. JavaScript Program</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done.</li>
          <li>You will need to follow the coding standards for the course.</li>
          <li>Once everything is working, go back and <strong>fill in</strong> the actual results sections in the test plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example Output</h3>

<pre class="output">
You entered 3 usernames. Here are the email addresses:

homer@student.cvtc.edu
bart@student.cvtc.edu
marge@student.cvtc.edu
</pre>

        <h3>Your Output:</h3>

<pre class="output">
<script src="js/lab09arrays.js"></script>
</pre>

        <h2>What You Did</h2>
        <p>You combined arrays, IF statements, counted, and uncounted loops to solve a more complex problem.</p>
