        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <blockquote>
          A program is needed that adds two decimal numbers. The program must add them together
          correctly and avoid rounding issues as much as possible.
          The program should prompt for the two decimal numbers, add them together, and print
          out the sum of the decimal numbers.
        </blockquote>
        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the above problem statement and paste it below so it appears in the black box when you refresh the page, underneath the words <code class="varname">PROBLEM STATEMENT</code>.</li>
          <li>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and write them in the appropriate locations so they appear in the black box below when you refresh the page.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT:

A program is needed that adds two decimal numbers. The program must add them together
correctly and avoid rounding issues as much as possible.
The program should prompt for the two decimal numbers, add them together, and print
out the sum of the decimal numbers.

Nouns:
2 decimal numbers, sum

Verbs:
prompt, add, print out
</pre>

      <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</li>
        <li>Make your variable names <strong>valid JavaScript names</strong> that conform to the course JavaScript Coding Standards.</li>
        <li>Write down the processes with very short statements, 2 or 3 words. Remember, this is not pseudocode. This is just the process.</li>
      </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  2 decimal numbers


PROCESSING:
  prompt for 2 decimal numbers
  add decimal numbers together
  print out sum


OUTPUTS:
  sum

</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a solution algorithm (using Pseudocode) based on the defining diagram. Remember to give your algorithm a name and use proper indentation.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
SOLUTION ALGORITHM:

AddTwoDecimalNumbers

  initialize number1 to 0.0
  initialize number2 to 0.0
  initialize sum to 0

  prompt for number1 with "What is the first decimal number?"
  prompt for number2 with "What is the second decimal number?"

  convert number1 to a number
  convert number2 to a number

  number1 = number1 * 100
  number2 = number2 * 100

  sum = number1 + number 2

  sum = sum / 100

  Display "The sum is " + sum

END

</pre>

        <h2>Explanation of Algorithm</h2>
        <p>Note this section of the pseudocode:</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
  number1 = number1 * 100
  number2 = number2 * 100

  sum = number1 + number 2

  sum = sum / 100
</pre>

        <p>
          Because decimals can't be added together with precision, we
          are multiplying the numbers by 100 to shift the decimal. This
          will help us preserve some precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we get the sum, we then divide by 100 to move the decimal
          back.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>

<pre class="pseudocode">
VARIABLES: number1, number2

TEST CASE 1:

  INPUT VALUES:  0.1, 0.2

  EXPECTED RESULT: 0.3

  ACTUAL RESULT: 0.3

TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES: 0.243, 0.344

  EXPECTED RESULT: 0.587

  ACTUAL RESULT: 0.5870000000000001

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES: 0, 2

  EXPECTED RESULT: 2

  ACTUAL RESULT: 2

TEST CASE 4:

  INPUT VALUES: -2.0. -2.5

  EXPECTED RESULT: -4.5

  ACTUAL RESULT: -4.5

</pre>

        <h3>5. JavaScript Code</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done.</li>
          <li>You will need to follow the coding standards for the course.</li>
          <li>Once everything is working, go back and <strong>fill in</strong> the actual results sections in the test plan.</li>
        </ul>

<pre><code class="js">var number1 = 0.0;
var number2 = 0.0;
var output = &quot;&quot;;
var sum = 0;

// prompts
number1 = prompt(&quot;What is the first decimal number?&quot;);
number2 = prompt(&quot;What is the second decimal number?&quot;);

// numerical conversions
number1 = Number(number1);
number2 = Number(number2);

number1 *= 100;  // shorthand compound operator
number2 *= 100;  // shorthand compound operator

sum = (number1 + number2) / 100;

output = &quot;The sum is &quot; + sum;

document.write(output);

</code></pre>
        <h3>Your Output:</h3>

<pre class="output">
<script id="student_code">
// YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:

var number1 = 0.0;
var number2 = 0.0;
var output = "";
var sum = 0;

// prompts
number1 = prompt("What is the first decimal number?");
number2 = prompt("What is the second decimal number?");

// numerical conversions
number1 = Number(number1);
number2 = Number(number2);

number1 *= 100;  // shorthand compound operator
number2 *= 100;  // shorthand compound operator

sum = (number1 + number2) / 100;

document.write(output);

// END OF YOUR CODE

</pre>

        <h3>What You Did</h3>
        <p>You just went through the full process of developing an application again, using a function to encapsulate the business logic of your program.. You found the nouns and verbs, you did a Defining Diagram, you created a solution algorithm with pseudocode, you devised a test plan, you wrote your code with documentation, and you tested your code, checking it against your testing plan.    <strong>You did remember to go back and fill in the actual results in your testing plan, right?</strong></p>
