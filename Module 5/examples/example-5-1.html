        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

        <blockquote><p><em><strong>Design a program that will prompt a user for three characters, accept those characters as input, sort them into ascending sequence and output them to the screen.</strong></em></p></blockquote>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>

        <p>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT:
  Design a program that will prompt a user for three characters,
  accept those characters as input, sort them into ascending
  sequence and output them to the screen.

Nouns: first character, second character, third character

Verbs: prompt, accept, sort, output
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>

        <p>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  character1
  character2
  character3

PROCESSING:
  prompt for characters
  accept three characters
  sort three characters
  output three characters

OUTPUTS:
  character1 unsorted
  character2 unsorted
  character3 unsorted

  character1 sorted
  character2 sorted
  character3 sorted
</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>

        <p>Create a solution algorithm based on the defining diagram.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
SortThreeCharacters
  Initialize swap to ""
  Prompt for character1 with "Enter a character"
  Prompt for character2 with "Enter a character"
  Prompt for character3 with "Enter a character"

  Display "Entered Characters\n"
  Display "Character 1:\t" + character1
  Display "Character 2:\t" + character2
  Display "Character 3:\t" + character3

  IF character1 &gt; character2 THEN
    swap = character1

  Display "Sorted Characters\n"
