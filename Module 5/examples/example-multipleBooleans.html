        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

        <blockquote><p><strong><em>A program is required that determines if someone gets a driver's license. The user is prompted for the age of the applicant, if the applicant passed the written exam, and if they passed the behind-the-wheel exam. The applicant is given a driver's license if they are at least 16 and they passed both exams.
        </em></strong></p></blockquote>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>

        <p>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    A program is required that determines if someone gets a
    driver's license. The user is prompted for the age of
    the applicant, if the applicant passed the written exam,
    and if they passed the behind-the-wheel exam. The
    applicant is given a driver's license if they are at
    least 16 and they passed both exams. Output a condolence
    if they don't get their license.

Nouns: driver's license, age, written exam, behind-the-wheel exam, condolence

Verbs: determines, prompted, passed, given
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>

        <p>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  age
  writtenExamResults
  behindTheWheelExamResults

PROCESSING:
  prompt for age
  convert entry to numeric age
  prompt for written exam results
  prompt for behind-the-wheel results
  award driver's license if all are ok

OUTPUTS:
  driversLicense
  condolence
</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>

        <p>Create a solution algorithm based on the defining diagram.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
AwardDriversLicence
  Prompt user for age
  Convert age to number
  Prompt user for writtenExamResults
  Prompt user for behindTheWheelExamResults
  IF age &gt;= 16 AND
     writtenExamResults is &quot;Y&quot; AND
     behindTheWheelExamResults is &quot;Y&quot; THEN
    Display &quot;Congratulations, here's your driver's license!&quot;
  ELSE
    Display  &quot;We're sorry, you didn't pass. Please retake the test again in 30 days&quot;
  ENDIF
END
</pre>

        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>

        <p>Create a test plan for the algorithm.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
VARIABLES: age, writtenExamResults, behindTheWheelExamResults,


TEST CASE 1:

  INPUT VALUES: 16, Y, Y

  EXPECTED RESULT: &quot;Congratulations, here's your driver's license!&quot;

  ACTUAL RESULT: &quot;Congratulations, here's your driver's license!&quot;


TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES: 15, Y, Y

  EXPECTED RESULT:  We're sorry, you didn't pass. Please retake the test again in 30 days

  ACTUAL RESULT:  We're sorry, you didn't pass. Please retake the test again in 30 days

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES: 17, Y, N

  EXPECTED RESULT:  We're sorry, you didn't pass. Please retake the test again in 30 days

  ACTUAL RESULT: We're sorry, you didn't pass. Please retake the test again in 30 days

        <h3>5. JavaScript Output</h3>

        <p>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done.</p>
        <p><strong>Here's the code:</strong></p>

<pre><code class="js">

        <h3>Think about it</h3>

        <p>How would you change this program so it handled lower-case &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;N&quot; answers?</p>
