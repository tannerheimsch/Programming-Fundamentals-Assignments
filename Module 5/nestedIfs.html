        <h3>Nested <code>if/else</code> Statements</h3>
        
        <p>What if you want to answer more than one question in a series? Or you want to test a variable for one of many options? We frequently have situations like this in programs. Here's some pseudocode that illustrates a common problem</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
IF choice1 is &quot;A&quot; THEN
  IF choice2 is &quot;2&quot; THEN
    IF choice3 is &quot;X&quot; THEN
      IF choice4 is &quot;Blue&quot; THEN
        Do a really important task!
      ENDIF           
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
ENDIF
</pre>

        <p>This is the same as using multiple logical <span class="caps">AND </span>(<code>&amp;&amp;</code>) expressions, with one important difference: we can use <span class="caps">ELSE </span>statements, too.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
IF choice1 is &quot;A&quot; THEN
  IF choice2 is &quot;2&quot; THEN
    IF choice3 is &quot;X&quot; THEN
      IF choice4 is &quot;Blue&quot; THEN
        Do a really important task!
      ELSE
        Do a not so important task.
      ENDIF           
    ELSE
      This is if choice3 isn't X. 
      We bypass choice4 altogether.
    ENDIF
  ELSE
    We're here because choice2 is not &quot;2&quot;. 
    We'll do something else instead.
  ENDIF
ELSE
    choice1 is not &quot;A&quot;
ENDIF
</pre>

        <p>How's this look? A bit complicated? It can get worse...</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
IF boolean THEN
  IF boolean THEN
    IF boolean THEN
      IF boolean THEN
        do something
      ELSE

      IF boolean THEN
        do something

        do something

        <p>But, this kind of coding is not that typical. Over time programmers have figured out that this is very fragile and you never really know if it works right. We now have lots of ways to avoid this type of monster. But before we can dig into those advanced methods, you need to understand how nested IF statements work and how they're used.</p>
        <p>We'll start with some basic patterns of <code>nesting our logic</code>.</p>
        <h3>Testing One Variable for Different Values</h3>
        
        <p>We frequently need to test one variable for many different values and do something different for each value.</p>
        <p>We have a choice variable and the user is asked to make a selection from a list. Doing this with deeply nested if/else statements is ugly! So most languages have better ways. This is usually called the "if, else if, else if, else" pattern among programmers. It looks like this in pseudocode.</p>

<pre  class="pseudocode">
IF choice is &quot;A&quot; THEN
  do the A things
ELSE IF choice is &quot;B&quot; THEN
  do the B things
ELSE IF choice is &quot;C&quot; THEN
  do the C things
ELSE IF choice is &quot;D&quot; THEN
  do the D things
ELSE IF choice is &quot;E&quot; THEN
  do the E things
ELSE IF choice is &quot;F&quot; THEN
  do the F things
ELSE IF choice is &quot;G&quot; THEN
  do the G things
ELSE
  do the default thing
ENDIF
</pre>

        <p>That's looks a little better! And here is a JavaScript version of the concept.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
// One variable, many choices

var choice = &quot;G&quot;;

if (choice === &quot;A&quot;) {
  document.write(&quot;The choice was A&quot;);
} else if (choice === &quot;B&quot;) {
  document.write(&quot;The choice was B&quot;);
} else if (choice === &quot;C&quot;) {
  document.write(&quot;The choice was C&quot;);
} else if (choice === &quot;D&quot;) {
  document.write(&quot;The choice was D&quot;);
} else if (choice === &quot;E&quot;) {
  document.write(&quot;The choice was E&quot;);
} else if (choice === &quot;F&quot;) {
  document.write(&quot;The choice was F&quot;);
} else if (choice === &quot;G&quot;) {
  =document.write(&quot;The choice was G&quot;);
} else {
  document.write(&quot;The choice was none of the above&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<pre class="output">
<script>
// One variable, many choices
var choice = "G";

if (choice === "A") {
  document.write("The choice was A");
} 
else if (choice === "B") {
	document.write("The choice was B");
} else if (choice === "C") {
	document.write("The choice was C");
} else if (choice === "D") {
	document.write("The choice was D");
} else if (choice === "E") {
	document.write("The choice was E");
} else if (choice === "F") {
	document.write("The choice was F");
} else if (choice === "G") {
	document.write("The choice was G");
} else {
	document.write("The choice was none of the above");
}
</script>
</pre>

        <p>This is a very useful and commonly used structure. The above code replaces what's below and does exactly the same work. Which would you rather do?</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
// Long version. Yuck!

if (choice === &quot;A&quot;) {
  document.write(&quot;The choice was A&quot;);
} 
else {
  if (choice === &quot;B&quot;) {
    document.write(&quot;The choice was B&quot;);
  } else {
    if (choice === &quot;C&quot;) {
      document.write(&quot;The choice was C&quot;);
    } else {
      if (choice === &quot;D&quot;) {
        document.write(&quot;The choice was D&quot;);
      } else {
        if (choice === &quot;E&quot;) {
          document.write(&quot;The choice was E&quot;);
        } else {
          if (choice === &quot;F&quot;) {
              document.write(&quot;The choice was F&quot;);
          } else {
            if (choice === &quot;G&quot;) {
              document.write(&quot;The choice was G&quot;);
            } else {
              document.write(&quot;The choice was none&quot;);
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}

        <h3>Testing Different Conditions With <code>if/else</code> structures.</h3>
        
        <p>Sometimes we <strong> have</strong> to nest <code>if/else</code> statements as it won't work any other way. We try to limit it and make it concise.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
// Nested ifs

var city = "Eau Claire";
var county = "Eau Claire";
var state = "WI";

state = prompt("What State do you live in?","WI");

if (state === "WI") {
  county = prompt("What county do you live in?","Eau Claire");
  if (county === "Eau Claire") {
    city = prompt("What city in Eau Claire county do you live in?","Altoona");
    if (city === "Eau Claire") {
      document.write("Eau Claire is a nice place");
    } else {
      document.write("There are other cities in Eau Claire County?");
    }
  } 
  else {
    city = prompt("What city do you live in?", "Osseo");
    if (city === "Osseo") {
      document.write("Too many Norwegians in Osseo.");
      } else {
      document.write("I don't know much about that city.");
    }
  }
} 
else {
  document.write("Goodbye!");
}
</code></pre>

<pre class="output">
<script>
// Nested ifs

var city = "Eau Claire";
var county = "Eau Claire";
var state = "WI";

state = prompt("What State do you live in?","WI");

if (state === "WI") {

	if (county === "Eau Claire") {

        <h3>Range Testing</h3>
        
        <p>We frequently need to test to see if a value is within a range. The technique to solve this combines nested <code>if/else</code> with multiple booleans.</p>
        <p>Pick a number between 1 and 10</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">
// Range Testing

var number;

//number = prompt(&quot;Pick a number between 1 and 10&quot;);

number = Number(number);

if (number &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; number &lt;= 10) {
  document.write(&quot;You got it right: &quot; + number);
} else {
  document.write(&quot;Your entry was out of range.&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<pre class="output">
<script>
// Range Testing

var number;

//number = prompt("Pick a number between 1 and 10");

number = Number(number);

if (number >= 1 && number <= 10) {
	document.write("You got it right: " + number);
} else {
	document.write("Your entry was out of range.");
}
</script>
</pre>

        <p>Using this technique we can pick from multiple ranges.</p>

<pre><code class="js">
// Multiple ranges

var number = 0;

number =  prompt(&quot;Pick a number between 1 and 50&quot;,25);

number = Number(number);

if (number &lt; 0) {
  document.write(&quot;That number is negative, I don't do negative.&quot;);
} else if (number &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; number &lt;= 10) {
  document.write(number + &quot; is between 1 and 10&quot;);
} else if (number &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; number &lt;= 20) {
  document.write(number + &quot; is between 10 and 20&quot;);
} else if (number &gt; 20 &amp;&amp; number &lt;= 30) {
  document.write(number + &quot; is between 20 and 30&quot;);
} else if (number &gt; 40 &amp;&amp; number &lt;= 50) {
  document.write(number + &quot; is between 40 and 50&quot;);
} else {
  document.write(number + &quot; is bigger than 50.&quot;);
}

</code></pre>

<pre class="output">
<script>
// Multiple ranges

var number = 0;

number =  prompt("Pick a number between 1 and 50",25);

number = Number(number);

if (number < 0) {
	document.write("That number is negative, I don't do negative.");
} else if (number >= 0 && number <= 10) {
	document.write(number + " is between 0 and 10");
} else if (number > 10 && number <= 20) {
	document.write(number + " is between 10 and 20");
} else if (number > 20 && number <= 30) {
	document.write(number + " is between 20 and 30");
} else if (number > 40 && number <= 50) {
	document.write(number + " is between 40 and 50");
} else {
  document.write(number + " is bigger than 50.");
}
