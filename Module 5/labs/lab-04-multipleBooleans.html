        <h3>Student Information</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Name: Tanner Heimsch</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Add your name in the appropriate area above.</li>
          <li>Read the problem statement.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Nouns and Verbs" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Defining Diagram" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Checking the Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Code the JavaScript program.
            <ol>
              <li>Add code after the line: <code class="keyword">YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:</code> to complete this lab.</li>
              <li>Your output should look like the <strong>Example Output</strong> at the bottom of the lab.</li>
              <li>Your code should be efficient and you should avoid unnecessary repetition of code.</li>
              <li>Remember to follow all coding standards and add appropriate comments!</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Remember to test everything.</strong> </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Lab problem statement</h3>

        <blockquote><p><strong><em>A program is required that asks a user to
                enter a number between 1 and 100 that does not include the end
                points (1 and 100). When a number in the correct range is
                entered then output the number and a message indicating
                success. If the number is not in the range then output the
                number and ask the user to try
                again.</em></strong></p></blockquote>

        <p><strong>For full points, your program should include only one output statement.</strong></p>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the above problem statement and paste it below so it appears in the black box when you refresh the page, underneath the words <code class="varname">PROBLEM STATEMENT</code>.</li>
          <li>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and write them in the appropriate locations so they appear in the black box below when you refresh the page.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="student pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT: A program is required that asks a user to enter a number between 1 and 100 
  that does not include the end points (1 and 100). When a number in the correct range is 
  entered then output the number and a message indicating success. If the number is not in the 
  range then output the number and ask the user to try again.


Nouns: a number between 1 and 100, end points, correct range, message success, try again

Verbs: ask, enter/entered, output, indicating
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</li>
          <li>Make your variable names <strong>valid JavaScript names</strong> that conform to the course JavaScript Coding Standards.</li>
          <li>Write down the processes with very short statements, 2 or 3 words. Remember, this is not pseudocode. This is just the process.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  userNumber

PROCESSING:
  prompt user for userNumber
  convert string to number
  check if userNumber is between 1 and 100
  check if usernumber is 1 or 100
  indicate right range if between 1 and 100
  indicate wrong and to try again if 1 or 100

OUTPUTS:
  userNumber
  userSuccess
  userTryAgain
</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a solution algorithm (using Pseudocode) based on the defining diagram. Remember to give your algorithm a name and use proper indentation.</li>
          <li>Ensure you include an appropriate level of detail for your input, processing, and output logic.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
// YOUR SOLUTION ALGORITHM GOES AFTER THIS LINE:

NumberRangeChecker
  Initialize userNumber to 0
  Initialize output to ""

  Prompt user for userNumber with "Please enter any number between 1-100 that isn't 1 or 100."
  Convert userNumber to number
  
  IF userNumber = 1 OR userNumber = 100 THEN
      output = "The number " + userNumber + " is out of the range, please try again."
  ELSE
      output = "The number " + userNumber + " is in the right range."
  ENDIF

  Display output
END
</pre>

        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a test plan for the algorithm.
            <ul>
              <li>Don't forget to fill in the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> section! That's easy to miss!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Have <b>at least 3 test cases</b> that test different inputs and outputs. </li>
        </ul>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
VARIABLES: userNumber

TEST CASE 1:

  INPUT VALUES: 2

  EXPECTED RESULT:
    The number 2 is in the right range.

  ACTUAL RESULT:
    The number 2 is in the right range.

TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES: 1

  EXPECTED RESULT: 
    The number 1 is out of the range, please try again.

  ACTUAL RESULT:
    The number 1 is out of the range, please try again.

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES: 999

  EXPECTED RESULT:
    The number 999 is out of the range, please try again.

  ACTUAL RESULT:
    The number 999 is out of the range, please try again.
</pre>

        <h3>5. JavaScript Code</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done.</li>
          <li>You will need to follow the coding standards for the course.</li>
          <li>Once everything is working, go back and <strong>fill in</strong> the actual results sections in the test plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example Output</h3>

<pre class="output">
The number 75 is in the right range.
</pre>


<p>or</p>



<pre class="output">
The number 200 is out of the range, please try again.
</pre>

        <h3>Your Output:</h3>

<pre class="output">
<script id="student_code">
// YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:

function NumberRangeChecker() {
  // Variables Defined
  var userNumber;
  var output = "";

  // Prompt user to type number between 1-100 that isn't 1 or 100, then convert to number
  userNumber = prompt("Please enter any number between 1-100 that isn't 1 or 100.");
  userNumber = Number(userNumber);

  // Determine if the number is less/greater than or equal to endpoints or if it is in the correct range, set output accordingly
  if (userNumber <= 1 || userNumber >= 100) {
    output = "The number " + userNumber + " is out of the range, please try again.";
  } else {
    output = "The number " + userNumber + " is in the right range."
  }

  // Display output
  document.write(output);
}
NumberRangeChecker();
// END OF YOUR CODE
</script>
