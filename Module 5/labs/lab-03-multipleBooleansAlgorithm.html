        <h3>Student Information</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Name: Tanner Heimsch</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>
        
        <ol>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name in the appropriate area above.</li>
          <li>Read the problem statement.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Nouns and Verbs" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Defining Diagram" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Complete the "Checking the Solution Algorithm" section.</li>
          <li>Code the JavaScript program.
            <ol>
              <li>Add code after the line: <code class="keyword">YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:</code> to complete this lab.</li>
              <li>Your output should look like the <strong>Example Output</strong> at the bottom of the lab.</li>
              <li>Remember to follow all coding standards and add appropriate comments!</li>
              </ol>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Remember to test everything.</strong> </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>

        <blockquote>
        		<p><strong><em>
              A program is required that asks a user what county they are from.
              If they are from Rusk or Dunn county then invite them to donate
              to a park cleanup fund. If they are from any other county then
              welcome them to the area. In either case, display the county of
              residence BEFORE displaying the conditional
              message.</em></strong></p></blockquote>

        <p><strong>For full points, your program should include only one output statement.</strong></p>

        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Copy the above problem statement and paste it below so it appears in the black box when you refresh the page, underneath the words <code class="varname">PROBLEM STATEMENT</code>.</li>
          <li>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement and write them in the appropriate locations so they appear in the black box below when you refresh the page.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="student pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT: A program is required that asks a user what county they are from. If they 
  are from Rusk or Dunn county then invite them to donate to a park cleanup fund. If they are 
  from any other county then welcome them to the area. In either case, display the county of 
  residence BEFORE displaying the conditional message.


Nouns: county, Rusk, Dunn, park cleanup fund, the area, county of residence, 
       conditional message

Verbs: asks, invite them to donate, welcome them, display
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</li>
          <li>Make your variable names <strong>valid JavaScript names</strong> that conform to the course JavaScript Coding Standards.</li>
          <li>Write down the processes with very short statements, 2 or 3 words. Remember, this is not pseudocode. This is just the process.</li>
        </ul>



<pre class="student pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  userCounty

PROCESSING:
  prompt user for userCounty
  check if userCounty is Rusk or Dunn
  check if userCounty is any other value
  invite them to donate to park cleanup fund if Rusk or Dunn
  welcome them to the area if any other value

OUTPUTS:
  userCounty
  fundInvite
  areaGreeting
</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Create a solution algorithm (using Pseudocode) based on the defining diagram. Remember to give your algorithm a name and use proper indentation.</li>
          <li>Ensure you include an appropriate level of detail for your input, processing, and output logic.</li>
        </ul>

<pre class="student pseudocode">
// YOUR SOLUTION ALGORITHM STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:

CountyMessenger
  Initialize userCounty to ""
  Initialize output to ""

  Prompt user for userCount with "Please enter ONLY the name of which county you live in (i.e. Rusk):"

  IF userCounty = Rusk OR userCounty = Dunn THEN
    output = "You live in " + userCounty + " County.\nPlease donate to the Park Cleanup fund."
  ELSE
    output = "You live in " + userCounty + " County.\nWelcome to the area!"
  ENDIF

  Display output
END
</pre>

        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Create a test plan for the algorithm.
            <ul>
              <li>Don't forget to fill in the <strong>VARIABLES</strong> section! That's easy to miss!</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Have <b>at least 3 test cases</b> that test different inputs and outputs. </li>
        </ul>

<pre class="pseudocode">
VARIABLES: userCounty

TEST CASE 1:

  INPUT VALUES: Rusk

  EXPECTED RESULT:
    You live in Rusk County.
    Please donate to the Park Cleanup fund.

  ACTUAL RESULT:
    You live in Rusk County.
    Please donate to the Park Cleanup fund.

TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES: Dunn

  EXPECTED RESULT:
    You live in Dunn County.
    Please donate to the Park Cleanup fund.

  ACTUAL RESULT:

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES: 4999

  EXPECTED RESULT:
    You live in 4999 County.
    Welcome to the area.

  ACTUAL RESULT:
    You live in 4999 County.
    Welcome to the area.
</pre>

        <h3>5. JavaScript Code</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done.</li>
          <li>You will need to follow the coding standards for the course.</li>
          <li>Once everything is working, go back and <strong>fill in</strong> the actual results sections in the test plan.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example Output</h3>

<pre class="output">
You live in Rusk County.
Please donate to the Park Cleanup fund.
</pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre class="output">
You live in Eau Claire county.
Welcome to the area.
</pre>

        <h3>Your Output:</h3>

<pre class="output">
<script id="student_code">
// YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE: 

function CountyMessenger() {
  // Variables Defined
  var userCounty;
  var output = "";

  // Prompt user to type which county they are from
  userCounty = prompt("Please enter ONLY the name of which county you live in (i.e. Rusk):");

  // Determine which message to send to user based off their answer, set output accordingly
  if (userCounty === "Rusk" || userCounty === "Dunn") {
    output = "You live in " + userCounty + " County.\nPlease donate to the Park Cleanup fund.";
  } else {
    output = "You live in " + userCounty + " County.\nWelcome to the area!";
  }
  
  // Display output
  document.write(output);
}
CountyMessenger();
// END OF YOUR CODE
