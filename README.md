# Programming Fundamentals Course Assignments
A digital export repository of all the assignments I have worked on in my Programming Fundamentals Course (HTML/CSS) I took for my IT-Data Analytics Specalist Associate's degree.

My coding additions are in the markdown of each of the .html files in the ./{Module #}/labs/ folders.
