        <h3>Lab Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Open this file in both Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name in the appropriate area.</li>
          <li>Review the example in the "My Turn" section below.  Look at the nouns and verbs pulled from the problem statement.</li>
          <li>In the "Your Turn" section, your job is to identify the nouns and verbs for each of the two problem statements.</li>
          <li>In Notepad++ locate the <code>YOUR PROBLEM STATEMENTS START AFTER THIS LINE:</code>section, where you can key in the nouns and verbs you identified in the problem statements.</li>
          <li>Write all the <strong>relevant</strong> nouns in the "nouns" areas. Not all nouns will be useful, we're trying to capture the important ones. Program and User are assumed, don't add these to the noun list.</li>
          <li>Write all the <strong>relevant</strong> verbs in the "verbs" areas. Not all verbs will be useful.</li>
          <li>Be sure to save your changes in Notepad++, and test to be sure your answers display on this page in Firefox!</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>My Turn:</h3>

<pre class="pseudocode">
Problem Statement: A program is required to read a Fahrenheit temperature,
convert it to Celsius and print the converted temperature. 
Celsius is determined by subtracting 32 from the Fahrenheit 
temperature and multiplying the result by 5/9.

Nouns: Fahrenheit temperature, converted temperature

Verbs: read, convert, print
  
</pre>

        <h3>Your Turn:</h3>
        <p>Here's your first problem statement:</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
YOUR PROBLEM STATEMENTS START AFTER THIS LINE:
</pre>

<pre class="pseudocode">
1. Problem Statement: A program is required to read a distance in miles,
calculate the distance in kilometers, and print the kilometers. One mile 
is 1.6 kilometers.

Nouns: distance in miles, distance in kilometers

Verbs: read, calculate, print

</pre>

        <p>And here's your second.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
2. Problem Statement: A program is required to prompt a user for 
radius and height of a cylinder. The program will calculate the 
volume of the cylinder and output the results. The formula for 
the calculation is:
  
  - Volume: PI times the radius squared times the height.
    
Nouns: radius, height, cylinder, volume

Verbs: prompt, calculate, output
  
</pre>

        <h3>What You Did</h3>
        <p>You practiced finding nouns and verbs in problem statements.</p>
