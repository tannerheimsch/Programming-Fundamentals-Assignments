        <ul>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++.</li>
          <li>Add your name in the appropriate spot.</li>
          <li>You can use your previous labs as a guides/examples.</li>
          <li>Read the following problem statement and complete all 5 steps in the development process.
            <ul>
              <li>Remember, you'll fill in the nouns and verbs, create the defining diagram, build the solution algorithm, create test plans, and then write the code.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li> This program will really test your ability to work with strings!</li>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em><strong>A program is required that prompts a user for the first name and last name of a dog owner and the name of his or her dog. The program will generate an information statement for the dog owner using the following pattern and then display the string on the page. (Check out the sample output below.)</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Example output: <strong>Lou Smith's dog is named "Fido&quot;.</strong></li>
          <li> These are the parts of the string:
            <ul>
              <li>First Name</li>
              <li>A space</li>
              <li>Last Name</li>
              <li>An apostrophe</li>
              <li>The letter <strong>s</strong></li>
              <li>A space</li>
              <li>This string of text: <strong>dog is named</strong></li>
              <li>A space</li>
              <li>A double quote mark</li>
              <li>The dog's name</li>
              <li>A period</li>
              <li>A double quote mark</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>
        <p>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement. Concentrate on the important nouns and verbs that are relevant to the problem.</p>


<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT: A program is required that prompts a user for the first name 
  and last name of a dog owner and the name of his or her dog. The program will generate an 
  information statement for the dog owner using the following pattern and then display 
  the string on the page.

Nouns: first name (dog owner), last name (dog owner), name (dog), information statement

Verbs: prompt, generate, display
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <p>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram. Follow the course naming standards for inputs and outputs.</p>


<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  ownerFirstName
  ownerLastName
  dogName


PROCESSING:
  read ownerFirstName
  read ownerLastName
  read dogName
  create informationStatement


OUTPUTS:
  output informationStatement
</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Create a solution algorithm based on the defining diagram.</p>


<pre class="pseudocode">
SOLUTION ALGORITHM

CreateInformationStatement
  Initialize ownerFirstName to ""
  Initialize ownerLastName to ""
  Initialize dogName to ""

  Prompt user for ownerFirstName with "Enter your first name:"
  Prompt user for ownerLastName with "Enter your last name:"
  Prompt user for dogName with "Enter your dog's name:"

  Set informationStatement = ownerFirstName + " " + ownerLastName + "\'s" + " dog is named " 
  + "\"" + dogName + ".\""

  Display informationStatement
END
</pre>

        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Create a test plan for the algorithm. You need to have <b>at least
            three</b> test cases. Once your JavaScript solution is running
          correctly, fill in the actual results.</p>

        <p>Don't forget to fill in the <span class="keyword">VARIABLES</span> section at the
          top of the test plan!</p>


<pre class="pseudocode">
VARIABLES: ownerFirstName, ownerLastName, dogName, informationStatement

TEST CASE 1:

  INPUT VALUES: Tanner, Heimsch, Fido

  EXPECTED RESULT: Tanner Heimsch's dog is named "Fido."

  ACTUAL RESULT: Tanner Heimsch's dog is named "Fido."

TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES: Essential War Domination Drone, 4, XT-9402020

  EXPECTED RESULT: Essential War Domination Drone 4's dog is named "XT-9402020."

  ACTUAL RESULT: Essential War Domination Drone 4's dog is named "XT-9402020."

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES: Cara-Adams Neal, Perry Smith, Douglas

  EXPECTED RESULT: Cara-Adams Neal Perry Smith's dog is named "Douglas."

  ACTUAL RESULT: Cara-Adams Neal Perry Smith's dog is named "Douglas."

</pre>

        <h3>5. JavaScript Code</h3>
        <p>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done. Your code must follow the course coding standards. You should add good comments about the different parts of your solution.</p>
        <h3><strong>Sample Output:</strong></h3>

<pre class="output">
Bart Simpson's dog is named &quot;Santa's Little Helper.&quot;</pre>

				<h3>Your Output:</h3>

<pre class="output">
<script id="student_code">
// YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:

/* Create an information statement that will display a dog owners first and last name as well as their dogs.
   This information statement will utilize proper punctuation in order to show possession.
*/

// Variables defined and set null
var ownerFirstName = "";
var ownerLastName = "";
var dogName = "";
var informationStatement = "";

// Get owner's first name, last name, and their dog's name
ownerFirstName = prompt("Enter your first name:");
ownerLastName = prompt("Enter your last name:");
dogName = prompt("Enter your dog's name:");

// Display the information statement
informationStatement = ownerFirstName + " " + ownerLastName + "\'s" + " dog is named " + "\"" + dogName + ".\"";

document.write(informationStatement);
// END OF YOUR CODE
</script>
</pre>


        <p><strong>What you learned</strong></p>
        <p>You got more practice writing JavaScript code, going through the entire development process. Keep it up. </p>
