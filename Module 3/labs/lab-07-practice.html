        <ul>
          <li>Name: YOUR NAME GOES HERE</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Specifications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open this file in Firefox and Notepad++</li>
          <li>Add your name in the usual spot</li>
          <li>Read the following problem statement and complete all 5 steps in the development process.
            <ul>
              <li>Remember, you'll fill in the nouns and verbs, create the defining diagram, build the solution algorithm, create test plans, and then write the code.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em><strong>A program is required that will receive two numbers from a user, calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the numbers. The program will display the two input numbers and the calculated results with identifying text.</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>
        <p>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement. Concentrate on the important nouns and verbs that are relevant to the problem.</p>


<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT: A program is required that will receive two numbers from a user, 
  calculate the sum, difference, product, and quotient of the numbers. The program will 
  display the two input numbers and the calculated results with identifying text.

Nouns: two numbers, sum, difference, product, quotient, results, identifying text

Verbs: receive, calculate, display
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <p>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram. Follow the course naming standards for inputs and outputs.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  number1
  number2

PROCESSING:
  read number1
  read number2
  calculate sum of number1 plus number2
  calculate difference of number1 minus number2
  calculate product of number1 times number2
  calculate quotient of number1 divided by number2
  create numberSum
  create numberDiff
  create numberProd
  create numberQuo

OUTPUTS:
  output numberSum
  output numberDiff
  output numberProd
  output numberQuo
</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Create a solution algorithm based on the defining diagram. (Don't forget the algorithm name and END).</p>


<pre class="pseudocode">
SOLUTION ALGORITHM

TwoNumbersCalculator
  Initialize number1 to 0
  Initialize number2 to 0
  Initialize numberSum to 0
  Initialize numberDiff to 0
  Initialize numberProd to 0
  Initialize numberQuo to 0

  Prompt for number1 with "Enter the first number:"
  Prompt for number2 with "Enter the second number:"

  Convert number1 to a number
  Convert number2 to a number

  Set numberSum = number1 + number2
  Set numberDiff = number1 - number2
  Set numberProd = number1 * number2
  Set numberQuo = number 1 / number2

  output = ""

  Display output
END
</pre>


        <h3>4. Checking the Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Create a test plan for the algorithm. You need to have <b>at least three</b> test cases. Once your JavaScript solution is running correctly, fill in the actual results.</p>

        <p>Don't forget to fill in the <span class="keyword">VARIABLES</span> section at the
          top of the test plan!</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
VARIABLES: number1, number2, numberSum, numberDiff, numberProd, numberQuo, output

TEST CASE 1:

  INPUT VALUES: 5, 5

  EXPECTED RESULT:
    Entered Numbers: 5, 5
    Sum: 10
    Difference: 0
    Product: 25
    Quotient: 1

  ACTUAL RESULT:
    Entered Numbers: 5, 5
    Sum: 10
    Difference: 0
    Product: 25
    Quotient: 1

TEST CASE 2:

  INPUT VALUES: 10, X

  EXPECTED RESULT:
    Entered Numbers: 10, X
    Sum: 10 + X
    Difference: 10 - X
    Product: 10 * X
    Quotient: 10 / X

  ACTUAL RESULT:
    Entered Numbers: 10, NaN
    Sum: NaN
    Difference: NaN
    Product: NaN
    Quotient: NaN

TEST CASE 3:

  INPUT VALUES: 55, 65

  EXPECTED RESULT:
    Entered Numbers: 55, 65
    Sum: 120
    Difference: -10
    Product: 3575
    Quotient: 0.85

  ACTUAL RESULT:
    Entered Numbers: 55, 65
    Sum: 120
    Difference: -10
    Product: 3575
    Quotient: 0.8461538461538461
</pre>

        <h3>5. JavaScript Code</h3>
        <p>Write the JavaScript code based on everything you've done. Your code must follow the course coding standards (Are you indenting correctly?). You should add good comments about the different parts of your solution.</p>
        <h3><strong>Sample Output:</strong><br />
        </h3>

<pre class="output">
Entered Numbers: 12, 10
Sum: 22
Difference: 2
Product: 120
Quotient: 1.2</pre>

				<h3>Your Output</h3>

<pre class="output">
<script id="student_code">
// YOUR CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:

// Variables defined and set null

        <p><strong>What you learned</strong></p>
        <p>You got more practice writing JavaScript code, going through the entire development process. You developed a defining diagram from nouns and verbs, you wrote pseudocode, then you developed a test plan. You then wrote code and tested your output against the testing plan. </p>
        <p>The more you do this, the better software developer you'll be. Now go back to the main page for more.</p>
