        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p><em><strong>A program is required to read from the screen the length and width of a rectangular yard, and the length and width of the rectangular house that has been built on the yard. The algorithm should then compute  the mowing time required to cut the grass around the house, at the rate of two square yards per minute. The program should display the length and width of the yard, the area of the yard, the length and width of hte house, the area of the house, the mowing area, and the mowing time.</strong></em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>1. Nouns and Verbs</h3>
        <p>Identify the nouns and verbs in the problem statement.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">PROBLEM STATEMENT: A program is required to read from the screen the
length and width of a rectangular yard, and the length and width of the
rectangular house that has been built on the yard. The algorithm should
then compute the mowing time required to cut the grass around
the house, at the rate of two square yards per minute. The program should display
the length and width of the yard, the area of the yard, the length and withd
of the house, the area of the house, the mowing area, and the mowing time.

Nouns: length and width of house, length and width of yard, mowing time

Verbs: read, compute, display
</pre>

        <h3>2. Defining Diagram</h3>
        <p>Convert the nouns and verbs into variable names and processes and create a defining diagram.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
INPUTS:
  yardLength
  yardWidth
  houseLength
  houseWidth

PROCESSING:
  prompt for yard measurements
  prompt for house measurements
  calculate mowingArea
  calculate mowingTime
  display mowingTime

OUTPUTS:
  yardLength
  yardWidth
  yardArea
  houseLength
  houseWidth
  houseArea
  mowingArea
  mowingTime

</pre>

        <h3>3. Solution Algorithm</h3>
        <p>Create a solution algorithm based on the defining diagram.</p>

<pre class="pseudocode">
CalculateMowingTime
  Initialize houseArea to 0
  Initialize houseLength to 0
  Initialize houseWidth to 0
  Initialize mowingArea to 0
  Initialize mowingTime to 0
  Initialize output to &quot;&quot;
  Initialize yardArea to 0
  Initialize yardLength to 0
  Initialize yardWidth to 0

  Prompt for yardLength with &quot;Enter the length of the yard&quot;
  Prompt for yardWidth with &quot;Enter the width of the yard&quot;
  Prompt for houseLength with &quot;Enter the length of the house&quot;
  Prompt for houseWidth with &quot;Enter the width of the house&quot;

  Convert yardLength to number
  Convert yardWidth to number
  Convert houseLength to number
  Convert houseWidth to number

  Set yardArea = yardLength * yardWidth
  Set houseArea = houseLength * houseWidth
  Set mowingArea = yardArea - houseArea
  Set mowingTime = mowingArea divided by 2

  Set output to output + &quot;Your yard is &quot; + yardLength + &quot; yards by &quot; + yardWidth&quot; + yards.&quot;
  Set output to output + &quot;Your yard area is &quot; + yardArea + &quot; square yards.&quot;
  Set output to output + &quot;Your house is &quot; + houseLength + &quot; yards by &quot; + houseWidth + &quot; yards.&quot;
  Set output to output + &quot;Your house area is &quot; + houseArea + &quot; square yards.&quot;
  Set output to output + &quot;The mowing area is &quot; + mowingArea + &quot; square yards.&quot;
  Set output to output + &quot;The mowing time is &quot; + mowingTime + &quot; minutes.&quot;

  Display output
