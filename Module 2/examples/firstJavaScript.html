// DEMO CODE STARTS AFTER THIS LINE:

// We put variables up here before anything else

var name = &quot;Fred&quot;;
var count = 10;

// our logic code

   It's good to have lots of lines like this that
   explain our code. For example the next line of code
   uses a &quot;break&quot; character, which is common in many
   programming languages.

   However, be very careful not to comment things that are obvious.
   Instead, comment  &quot;why&quot;, not what.
*/

document.write(&quot;Your count is &quot; + count);

// The next line of code is what we call &quot;Commented out&quot;.
// This means that we don't want it to run but we don't
// want to delete it.

//alert(&quot;Yo, &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;);

// END OF YOUR CODE
